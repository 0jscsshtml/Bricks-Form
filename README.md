# Custom Login/Register/Password Lost/Password Reset Page with Bricks Builder Form Element

#1 Create Login/Register/Password Lost/Password Reset Page as usual

#2 Copy all the code in function.php to Bricks Child theme function.php. Im not suggest to use WPCode or other code snippets plugin. If you lock out from dashboard, you still can delete all the code that you inserted and all will back to as normal.
